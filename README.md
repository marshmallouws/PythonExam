# Spotify song suggestions
## Synopsis

We will use a data set that has attributes rather than make a direct call to Spotify's API.

Purpose:
* Use machine learning to give a list of suggested songs.
* Create a simple Flask server that can take a list of loved and hated songs and make suggestions from this.
  * The user input should make an API-call that does autocomplete suggestion of known song names from the dataset

Technologies in use:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Generators
* Flask
* Files
* Neural network (prediction of songs that may interest the user)
* Machine learning

Challenges:
* Machine learning
* RESTapi - making song suggestions for users

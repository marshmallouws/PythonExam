Along with his Neptunes partner Chad Hugo, he produced the track.Jay-Z did a remake of this song where he mentions R. Kelly, telling him to drop the lawsuit Kelly filed against him like it's hot.Snoop Dogg Snoop rewrote and re-recorded the track in 2012 under the new title \"Pocket Like It's Hot\" for a campaign for US microwavable snack brand Hot Pockets.\n"
